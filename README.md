# Hack-/

Hack-/ is an [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) written in Haskell specifically for game development. At the moment it only exposes low level game primitives, however, in the future may have networking and graphical APIs added as time permits.

## Status

**Experimental!** While the API is currently in a good place (2016-11-09) the performance and correctness of the code is currently being verified as the primary driving project [Armored Bits](https://armoredbits.com) is being refactored on top of it. It is not recommended to actually try to use this library in any way shape or form for the time being.
